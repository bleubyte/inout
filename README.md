Automating signing on and off work at simpleinout.com

So I wrote this script for a friend of mine, its pretty simple, You will need Python, selenium, and chrome drive. 
it automates signing on and off (twice a day)
Also added a notification feature via SMS using Amazons SNS service once the task is completed.

Adjust the time and run the script.
I tested it with Pyinstaller  (compiled it into an portable executable) and worked well during testing.

Enjoy and never be late for work again
